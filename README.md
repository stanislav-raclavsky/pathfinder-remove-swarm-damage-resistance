# Remove Swarm Damage Resistance

A mod for Pathfinder: Kingmaker which removes damage resistance from all swarms.
I programmed this mod primarily for myself because the inability to destroy the Spider Swarm almost put me off this game - maybe it will be useful for someone else.
You can destroy the Spider Swarm and other swarms with your weapons now, enjoy :)
